# Student_Performance_Analysis
# üéì Capstone Project: Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

**Course:** INSY 8413 ‚Äì Introduction to Big Data Analytics  
**Institution:** Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA)  
**Instructor:** Eric Maniraguha  
**Student:** Lesly Akanyana  
**Year:** 2025

## üìå Project Overview

This capstone project explores student performance by analyzing demographic and educational factors to uncover trends and make predictive insights. The project uses a **real-world dataset** from the **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)** and applies **Python for data analysis & machine learning**, and **Power BI for visualization and dashboarding**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- To clean, preprocess, and analyze student data from a virtual learning platform.
- To build a predictive model that classifies student outcomes (Pass/Fail/Withdraw/Distinction).
- To design an interactive Power BI dashboard highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs).
- To derive actionable insights for academic stakeholders to improve learning strategies.

## üßæ Dataset Used

**Filename:** `studentInfo.csv`  
**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì [OULAD Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Open+University+Learning+Analytics+Dataset)

### Key Columns:
- `id_student`: Unique student ID  
- `gender`: Male/Female  
- `region`: Geographic location  
- `highest_education`: Student's prior education level  
- `imd_band`: Socioeconomic indicator  
- `age_band`: Age group  
- `disability`: Disability status  
- `final_result`: Target variable ‚Äì final outcome of student (Pass/Fail/etc.)

## üìä Power BI Dashboard Summary (`Student_Performance.pbix`)

**Dashboards Created:**
- Final Result distribution by:
  - Gender
  - Age Band
  - Region
  - Highest Education
  - Disability status
- Filters (Slicers) for deep drill-down
- Interactive visuals showing relationships between features

Power BI helps reveal how demographics influence academic success and dropout patterns.

## üß† Key Insights

- Students with higher prior education levels tend to perform better.
- Students with disabilities and from lower IMD bands show increased risk of failure or withdrawal.
- Age and gender also play significant roles in final outcomes.
- The predictive model can help flag at-risk students early.
